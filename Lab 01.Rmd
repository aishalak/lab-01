## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "aishalak", user.email = "alakshma@ucsc.edu")
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("tidyverse")
trails <- read_csv("data/SFO-trails.csv")

glimpse(trails)

ggplot(data = trails, aes(x = status)) + geom_bar() + labs(x = "Status", y = "Number of Observations", title = "Status of SFO Trails")
trails %>% count(status) %>% mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))
current_trails <- trails %>% filter(status == "Existing", !is.na(length))
ggplot(data = current_trails) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = length), binwidth = 0.5) + labs(x = "Length", y = "Number of Observations", title = "Length of SFO Trails")
```
