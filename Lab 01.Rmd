## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
# install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "aishalak", user.email = "alakshma@ucsc.edu")
library(tidyverse)
# install.packages("tidyverse")
trails <- read_csv("SFO-trails.csv")
glimpse(trails)
```
Exercise 1: The very top of the output tells us the number of rows and columns in the dataset. The number of rows represents the number of observations and the number of columns the number of variables. Therefore, the trails dataset contains 739 observations and 12 variables.
Exercise 2: A bar graph is most appropriate to visualize the distribution of “status” because the status data shows that trails fall under the category of “existing” or “proposed”. A bar graph allows to visualize the number of existing and proposed trails in the dataset. Now, lets calculate the proportion of observations in each category of status.

```{r}
ggplot(data = trails, aes(x = status)) + geom_bar() + labs(x = "Status", y = "Number of Observations", title = "Status of SFO Trails")
trails %>% count(status) %>% mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))
```
Exercise 3: The code below creates a subset consisting only of trails that currently exist and have a value reported for length.
```{r}
current_trails <- trails %>% filter(status == "Existing", !is.na(length))
```
Exercise 4: The code below shows two ways to create a graph to visualize the distribution of length with the ggplot2 package.
```{r}
ggplot(data = current_trails) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = length), binwidth = 0.5) + labs(x = "Length", y = "Number of Observations", title = "Length of SFO Trails")
ggplot(data = current_trails, mapping = aes(x = as.factor(class), y = length)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = "Trail Class", y = "Trail Length", title = "Length of SFO Trails", subtitle = "By Class")
```
Exercise 5. 
```{r}
current_trails %>%
    summarise(min = min(length), 
              q1 = quantile(length, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)), 
              median = median(length), 
              q3 = quantile(length, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)), 
              max = max(length), 
              iqr = IQR(length), 
              mean = mean(length), 
              std_dev = sd(length))
```
Exercise 6. 
The histogram for length is skewed right, meaning that mean is to the right of the median. The mean and median tells us about the center of the distribution. According to the summary statistic, the mean trail length is 0.724 miles  and the median trail length is 0.448 miles. According to the the summary statistic, the standard deviation is 0.852 miles. In the boxplot, there are many outliers in class 1 trails. 
Exercise 7. 
If we want to filter the data to display trails suitable for day hikes, we can use the code veiw trails that are 5 miles or shorter. 
```{r}
current_trails %>% filter(length <= 5, !is.na(length))
```
 Exercise 8. 
Trails are divided into three categories under class: class 1, class 2, and class 3. We can see that in the histogram, most trails fall under class 1. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = current_trails) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = class), binwidth = 0.5) + labs(x = "Class", y = "Trail Count", title = "Trail Class")
```
I think the most likely reason for missing observations in class is due to trail upkeep and maintenance, and logging the changes in the data. Updating trail conditions may result in a duplicate entry, and this might be why the two observations with no entry for class are very similar to the entry that follows them.  
Exercise 9. 
```{r}
trail_class <- current_trails %>% filter(class !=3) %>% 
  mutate(class = if_else(is.na(class),1,class))
```
Exercise 10. 
```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=class,y=length),data=current_trails)+
  geom_point() + labs(x = "Trail Class", y = "Trail Length", title = "Trail Length By Class") 
```
Exercise 11. 
By looking at the graph made in exercise 10, we can see that the trails with the greatest length lie in class 1. Most trails are in the class 1 category and least trails are in the class 3 category. Considering that class 1 = shared use bicycle and pedestrian path, class 2 = bike lane, and class 3 = bike route, it follows that class 3 has the shortest length because class 3 is restricted to bike route trails. 
Exercise 12. 
```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=class,y=length),data=trail_class)+
  geom_point() + labs(x = "Trail Class", y = "Trail Length", title = "Trail Length By Class 1 and Class 2") 
```
Independence is met because class 1 and class 2 are mutually exclusive. The sample size of observations is large enough to meet the conditions of sample size. Independent groups is satisfied because class 1 and class 2 are being measured by the same the same conditions, but class 1 represents shared use bicycle and pedestrain path trails and class 2 represents bike lane trails. 
Exercise 13. 
The null hypothesis represents the case in which length and class no don't have a linear association. The alternative hypothesis represents the case in which length and class have a linear association, whether the association is positive or negative. 
Exercise 14.
# need help with exercise 14
?t.test # to see the help page from the function
t.test(length ~ class, data = trail_class, 
       alternative = c("less", "greater", "two.sided"), 
       conf.level = 0.99) #less, greater, or two.sided
Exercise 15. 
In the case of this problem, the test statistic determines a possible conclusion of whether length and class no don't have a linear association or if length and class have a linear association, whether the association is positive or negative.
The p-value tells us whether we should reject or not reject our null hypothesis, and in the context of this problem, if we should or not reject the possible conclusion that length and class no don't have a linear association. 
Note* Since I was struggling with exercise 14, I can't answer the remaining questions correctly.I will get back to the remaining exercises once I can create the correct t.test code.
